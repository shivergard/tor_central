#TOR Central

Source of [Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/shivergard/tor_central)

BackStory: Found my self in Hospital and had to stay for a while. I got one of My PC with me , but my other was (is - date 7.3.2018) at home plugged to electicity. It works and does it rutine stuff , but I can not access it.

So this is a solution how to access PC externaly with TurnedOn TOR ssh service (+ can be used as connector itself)

No manual - explore docker compose , Dockerfile and other files. Code is not that much and it is selfExplaining
